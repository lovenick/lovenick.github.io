Oddly, this past weekend, I found myself with some distraction free time. I figured it would be a great chance to revist some old JS favorites (Backbone) and play around with a newish SaaS business called [Plivo](http://www.plivo.com), a direct competitor to Twilio.

Plivo is a service that allows developers to send and receive both voice calls and SMS message via an API. While similar to Twilio, Plivo has a couple pricing differences that made it more attractive for this project. 

First, Plivo doesn't charge for incoming SMS messages, where as Twilio charges $0.0075 per message (clearly this would break the bank). Second, the local numbers are slightly cheaper - $1 versus $0.80 per month. Nothing too drastic, but with volume, this could add up quickly. 

I realize pricing isn't the best model to base your SaaS decisions on, but since this was just a fun project, cheaper is better. Plus, I've had extensive experience with Twilio, so I'm quite interested to see the differences with Plivo.

Instead of getting into the nitty-gritty details of this project, I'm going to give a quick high-level overview.

For the back-end tech I used Node.js with Express, Mongoose and Jade (among the usual culprits of Underscore, Debug and Bunyan), while the front-end comprised of Backbone and Stylus. I ended up configuring an Ubuntu/Nginx droplet on DigitalOcean and installed the Node Forever module to keep the app running.

The project's architecture is very simple; an SMS is sent to one of the local numbers in Plivo, which creates a POST request to a pre-configured endpoint. This Express endpoint parses the data, creates a Mongoose model and saves it to MongoDB. The front-end is rendered via Backbone routes and the models / collections hit a custom RESTful API for data. That's it. Not bad for a couple hours of playing around on a Saturday.

Consider [SMSFlow.co](http://www.smsflow.co) my own TODO MVC without the to do list. Future upgrades will include purchasing numbers, editing and sending messages, call forwarding and custom "chat rooms" via phone numbers. All in due time.

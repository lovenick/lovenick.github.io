Oddly, this past weekend, I found myself with some distraction free time. I figured it would be a great chance to revist some old JS favorites (Backbone) and play around with a newish SaaS business called [Plivo](http://www.plivo.com) (direct competitor to Twilio).

Plivo is a service that allows developers to send and receive both voice calls and SMS message via an API. While similar to Twilio, Plivo has a couple pricing differences that made it more attractive for this project. 

First, Plivo doesn't charge for incoming SMS messages, where as Twilio charges $0.0075 per message (clearly this would break the bank). Second, the local numbers are slightly cheaper ($1 versus $0.80 per month). 

I realize pricing isn't the best model to base your SaaS decisions on, but since this was just a fun project, cheap is better. Plus, I've had extensive experience with Twilio, so I'm quite interested to see how Plivo tackles it.

Instead of getting into the details of this project, I'm going to give a quick high-level overview. For the backend tech I used Node.js with Express, Mongoose and Jade (among the usual culprits of Underscore, Debug and Bunyan), while the front-end comprised of Backbone and Stylus.

The project architecture is very simple; an SMS is sent to one of the local numbers in Plivo, which creates a POST request to a pre-configured endpoint. This Express endpoint parses the data, creates a Mongoose model and saves it to a MongoDB collection. The front-end is rendered via Backbone routes and the models / collections hit a RESTful API for data. That's it. Not bad for a couple hours of playing around.

Consider [SMSFlow.co](http://www.smsflow.co) my own TODO MVC without the to do list. Future upgrades will include purchasing numbers, edit and sending messages, call forwarding and custom "chat rooms". All in due time.

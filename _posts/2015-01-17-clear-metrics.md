A couple of months ago, I found the need to import my social media metrics directly into Google Analytics. Turns out, there aren't any services to do so; atleast none that I could find. Yes there are many services that aggregate data, just not directly into Google Analytics. So, ClearMetrics.io was born.

The plan is to build out the back-end over the next couple weeks using Node and MongoDB, while designing the front-end UX with Backbone and possibly React (moving away from AngularJS for the time being). The exact SOA isn't complete yet, but I should have something finalized early this coming week. More on that soon. 

Since there were zero restrictions on the design, I figured this was a great chance to try out Sketch from [Bohemian Coding](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). Turns out, Sketch is fantastic when it comes to vector based web design. Zooming and font rendering can be a little buggy, but in my opinion, totally worth the relatively small investment. If you're just getting started in web design and feel overwhelmed in Photoshop, definately check out Sketch.

Without further ado...

PS. Haven't worked out a logo yet, hence the blurring.

Happy New Year! Well, almost. At the time of this writing it's actually December 30th, 2014. Since I've managed to take some holiday time this year, I figured it's a good time to set some goals for 2015. By listing them publically I hope to achieve some level of accountability.

In no specific order, here's what I will achieve in 2015.

* Functional Programming - I've touched on it a bit, but feel like I'm just scratching the surface.
* Deep Dive into Node.js - Enough said.
* Revisit JS Frameworks and Libraries - Backbone, Angular, Underscore, ect.
* Learn New JS Frameworks - React, Ember, ect.
* Revisit CoffeeScript - It's been awhile, time to brush up.
* Swift - Develop and launch an app.
* SaaS Apps - I've got a couple in mind and a couple almost at MVP - Time to launch and iterate.
* Writing - It's obvious I'm not the best writer, 2015 will be the year I correct this.
* Blog - Relates to the goal above. 
* First Aid - Become certified in O.F.A level 1 or more.
* Algorithms and Design Patterns - Learn more advanced techniques.
* Design - It use to be my bread and butter, time to start putting pencil to paper (mouse to pixel?)
* VIM - I'm still a rookie, but can already see the benefits.
* ? Language - Perhaps another new language? Go, Haskell, Objective C... hmmm.

Am I missing anything? 2015's looking to be a busy year, but a fun one. At the end of each month, I'll revisit my goals and outline my achievements and roadblocks. 

Here's to a banner 2015.
